# Hi, I’m Alexis Cao
I am a Backend Engineer with a focus on building scalable and reliable distributed systems. My technical path is driven by a deep interest in high-performance architectures, primarily working with Go and Python.

My professional background in the construction industry provided me with a unique approach to software: I view code as infrastructure that must be built on solid foundations. I apply this mindset to develop:

- Real-time systems using gRPC and Kafka for efficient data streaming.

- Asynchronous microservices with FastAPI and RabbitMQ to optimize workloads.

- Robust data layers leveraging PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch for complex queries.

I am passionate about Clean Architecture and best practices, ensuring that the solutions I deliver are not just functional, but also maintainable and ready for long-term growth.

## Skills
- Languages Go, Python, JavaScript (Express)
- Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
